# Angular Frontend

This is the main frontend for the application, assuming the [expressServer](../backend/) is running, these pages will do the rest.

To run this website, just run the following command:

```
npm i && npm run start
```

This requires you to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed on your device.
